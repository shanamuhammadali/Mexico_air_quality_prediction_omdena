# Time series analysis for MER station data

Overview : This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) focused on time series analysis in air quality data for MER station. The project specifically investigates pollutants that pose significant health risks, including SO2, CO, NO2, and PM25, over the period 2021â€“2024. Using statistical methods and visualizations, this EDA provides insights into how air quality measurements change over time and identify any trends or seasonal effects..

The Analysis is done in two files.

File1 :Time_series_Analysis_MER_pollutants : Trends and seasonal effect of pollutants PM2.5,PM10,O3,SO2,NO2,CO
File2 :Time_series_Analysis_AQI_MER: Trends and seasonal effect of AQI with respect to pollutants and environmental factors
