Air Quality Prediction and Personalized Health Recommendations for Mexico City by Omdena Local Chapter
Challenge Background
Mexico City, one of the world's largest metropolitan areas, has long struggled with air pollution due to its geography, high population density, and industrial activities. The city's air quality significantly impacts the health and quality of life of its over 21 million residents.


The Problem
Despite improvements in recent years, Mexico City still experiences frequent poor air quality episodes. Current systems provide general air quality information but lack personalized recommendations, especially for vulnerable populations.


Goal of the Project
1. Prediction Accuracy:

Achieve 85% accuracy in 24-hour air quality forecasts for major pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, SO2, CO).
Provide accurate predictions for at least 90% of Mexico City's neighborhoods.
2. User Adoption:

Attract users in Mexico City within the first year of launch.
Maintain a 60% user retention rate after six months.
3. Personalization:

Develop at least 10 distinct user profiles based on health conditions and sensitivity to air pollution.
Provide personalized recommendations that are rated as "helpful" by 80% of users.
4. Data Integration:

Successfully integrate real-time data from at least 30 air quality monitoring stations across Mexico City.
Incorporate data from at least three additional sources (e.g., traffic, weather, satellite imagery) to improve predictions.
5. System Performance:

Ensure the app can handle up to concurrent users without performance degradation.
Provide air quality updates and alerts within 5 minutes of new data becoming available.
6. Stakeholder Engagement:

Establish partnerships with at least five major hospitals or health clinics in Mexico City for data sharing and validation.
Collaborate with at least three environmental NGOs for promotion and community outreach.
7. Policy Impact:

Provide data-driven reports to city officials that influence at least two air quality improvement initiatives within the first two years.
8. Scalability:

Design the system architecture to allow expansion to at least three other major Mexican cities within two years of launch.
10. Accessibility:

Ensure the app is usable by people with disabilities, meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
Provide the app interface in both Spanish and English, with support for at least one indigenous language.
